```yaml
trigger:
- master

pool:
  name: LinuxHostedPool   # You can get the Agent pool Name = organizationName/ProjectName/Settings/Agent pools/LinuxHostedPool
  demands:
    - Docker -equals yes  #Under this Agent pool, LinuxHostedPool -> Agents ->  several machines are available. User-defined capabilities

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'

- script: |
    echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
    echo See https://aka.ms/yaml
  displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'
```

In Azure DevOps, the `demands` section is used to define specific capabilities or requirements for the agents that will run the pipeline jobs. It helps ensure that the pipeline job is executed on an agent that meets the defined demands.

### What is a **demand**?
A demand is a condition that an agent must meet in order to run the pipeline job. This can be based on:
- Capabilities of the agent (e.g., installed software, specific tools).
- Agent-specific properties or environment variables.
  
### How Does it Work?
In the `demands` section, you can specify a list of key-value pairs where:
- **Key**: Represents the capability or property of the agent.
- **Value**: Represents the required value for that capability.

### Example: Docker Demand

In your YAML example:
```yaml
pool:
  name: LinuxHostedPool  
  demands:
    - Docker -equals yes
```

- **Key**: `Docker`
- **Value**: `yes`
  
This means that the job will only run on agents that have Docker installed and can respond with `Docker` as a capability set to `yes`.

### Common Use Cases for Demands:
1. **Tool Availability**: You can specify that the agent must have certain tools installed (e.g., Docker, Node.js, Java).
2. **Operating System**: You can ensure the agent is running a specific OS version.
3. **Software Version**: You can specify that an agent must have a specific version of a software tool installed.
4. **Custom Agent Capabilities**: You can create custom capabilities on your self-hosted agents and use demands to ensure the job runs only on suitable agents.

### Example: Multiple Demands

You can specify multiple demands to filter out agents that meet multiple requirements:

```yaml
pool:
  name: LinuxHostedPool  
  demands:
    - Docker -equals yes
    - Node -greaterThan 14
    - OS -equals Ubuntu
```

This example ensures that the job runs on agents:
- That have Docker installed.
- Where the Node.js version is greater than 14.
- Running on Ubuntu.

### Where are Demands Defined?

- **Predefined Capabilities**: Azure DevOps agents (both hosted and self-hosted) automatically provide some predefined capabilities like operating system, installed software (e.g., Docker, Node.js).
  
- **Custom Capabilities on Self-hosted Agents**: If you're using self-hosted agents, you can define custom capabilities (e.g., by setting environment variables or installing specific tools). These capabilities can then be referenced as demands in your YAML file.

### How to View Agent Capabilities:
1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Agent Pools**.
2. Select the agent pool you're using (e.g., `LinuxHostedPool`).
3. Select an agent and click on **Capabilities** to view the list of capabilities for that agent.
   
### Summary:
- **`demands`** in the pipeline YAML file define conditions that must be met by the agent before the pipeline job can run.
- They can be based on predefined or custom capabilities of the agent, like specific tools, software versions, or even operating systems.
